# movie-recommendation-java
A DIY version of a simple movie recommendation system in Java. 

## Introduction
Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? THis project demonstrates a feel of how it works by building a simplified recommender engine!

While this project works with data for movies, including ratings, the underlying principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. This program answers questions about the data including **which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies.** 

## Recommendation System
Given input files on users ratings and movie titles:
1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps
2. Calculate average ratings
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
